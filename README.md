# ITEC-621-Group-Project

This is a repository for a team project for the academic class ITEC-621. 

To learn how to create a local Git Repository for this project read http://happygitwithr.com chapter 16 starting with section 16.2

The core of this project focuses around the dataset provided from the Kaggle dataset: Where it Pays to Attend College (https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) created by the Wall Street Journal. Those csv files are as follows degrees-that-pay-back.csv, salaries-by-college-type.csv, salaries-by-region.csv. The data on college costs, number of undergraduates, and admission rates were found on the website www.collegedata.com.

R scripts will be added eventually and listed here along with basic premise of the script.

Excel/CSV files will be added eventually and listed here along with basic premise of the script.
