# ITEC-621-Group-Project

This is a repository for a team project for the academic class ITEC-621. 

The core of this project focuses around the dataset provided from the Kaggle dataset: Where it Pays to Attend College (https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) created by the Wall Street Journal. Those csv files are as follows degrees-that-pay-back.csv, salaries-by-college-type.csv, salaries-by-region.csv. The data on college costs were found on the website www.collegedata.com.
